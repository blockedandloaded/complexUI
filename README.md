# This is a more fleshed out and more complex UI with features that the simpler, blockchain implementation has not implemented. We used a template for this version to build our ideas visually. Ideally we would eventually merge these two to form a hybrid UI! This frontend is not as lightweight as our other and gave us issues with deployment.

# To run this version of our UI: 
    • clone repo 
    • gulp serve
        
Note that if you have not installe Node.js this may require you to download it.
