    <h4>Blocked + Loaded is a peer-to-peer network built for smart gun owners and sellers on the ethereum blockchain. For the first time ever, smart gun owners have the opportunity for proof of ownership in a way that is secure and trustworthy. </h4>

    <h4> Each gun that is registered into the system is then tied to a token called a PISTL. While these tokens are not a digital currency like Bitcoin, they offer the same security: each PISTL is one-of-a-kind and 100% owned by you. It cannot be replicated, destroyed, or taken away. </h4>
    
        <div class="line" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px"></div>

    <h4> That is, unless you want to give it to someone else! Smart guns and their PISTL representations can be sold and traded respectively to anyone else who is part of the network. </h4>
